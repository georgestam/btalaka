      courses_description_html: The Btalaka Project brings together years of experience
        from working with other therapies. We have combined the best from the early
        pioneering work of these therapies, together with the experiences and lessons
        we have learned from helping in the recovery of many hundreds of people from
        stammering over the years. Your Btalaka training commences with a three-day
        course. <br><br> Training on all Btalaka courses is on a one to one basis,
        given by recovering stammerers. It combines compassion and care throughout
        in teaching proven successful methods of diaphragmatic retraining (costal
        breathing), avoidance reduction therapy and positive attitude development.
        On a Btalaka Project training course, we are ever mindful of the individuality
        of every stammerer, and that their recovery from stammering will be at their
        own pace and in their own time. <br><br> For this reason, we always restrict
        the number of people on a course, to ensure the maximum individual attention.
        We have regular breaks during the day, and of course at lunch time, to ensure
        you stay ‘fresh’. We keep a training day to your maximum input level – not
        your exhaustion point. Days start at 9 a.m. and finish between 5 and 6 p.m.
        <br><br> We want to help you learn control, not to break you! In the evenings
        there is plenty of opportunity to practise your new technique in a relaxed
        social situation and around the table during dinner, together with everyone
        else on the course, in the hotel restaurant.
