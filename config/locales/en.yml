      courses_description_html: The Starfish Project brings together years of experience
        from working with other therapies. We have combined the best from the early
        pioneering work of these therapies, together with the experiences and lessons
        we have learned from helping in the recovery of many hundreds of people from
        stammering over the years. Your Starfish training commences with a three-day
        course. <br><br> Training on all Starfish courses is on a one to one basis,
        given by recovering stammerers. It combines compassion and care throughout
        in teaching proven successful methods of diaphragmatic retraining (costal
        breathing), avoidance reduction therapy and positive attitude development.
        On a Starfish Project training course, we are ever mindful of the individuality
        of every stammerer, and that their recovery from stammering will be at their
        own pace and in their own time. <br><br> For this reason, we always restrict
        the number of people on a course, to ensure the maximum individual attention.
        We have regular breaks during the day, and of course at lunch time, to ensure
        you stay ‘fresh’. We keep a training day to your maximum input level – not
        your exhaustion point. Days start at 9 a.m. and finish between 5 and 6 p.m.
        <br><br> We want to help you learn control, not to break you! In the evenings
        there is plenty of opportunity to practise your new technique in a relaxed
        social situation and around the table during dinner, together with everyone
        else on the course, in the hotel restaurant.

      summary_description_html: We welcome you to the Starfish Project. We do not
        promise a non-existent cure for stuttering, we will not try and hypnotise
        you, or sell you and ask you to wear any gadget or device. Our aim is to provide
        decent, effective therapy with free lifetime support, to as many people who
        stutter as possible, to control stuttering. Our aim is to provide that therapy
        without making huge profits out of your misfortune of having a Stutter (Stammer).
        We hope that you find the joy of effortless speech with the Starfish Project.<br><br>.The
        Starfish Project has been invited to come to the Emirates by Rakan Otaibi
        a recovering stutterer from Saudi Arabia. Rakan became very disillusioned
        by the way that diaphragmatic retraining (costal breathing), was introduced
        into the U.A.E. by expensive franchised multi-level marketing. Rakan believes
        that the introduction of the Starfish Project will help to bring effective,
        accessible and supported therapy to a greater numbers of people who stammer
        in the region at a decent affordable price. We are planning our first course
        for 2016 to be held in Dubai. Please contact us for more details of this course.

        <p>Lack of back up support &#8211; is by far the most common reason given
        on Starfish course application forms in reply to &#8216;why do you think other

        on-going care and follow up from everyone involved in The Starfish Project

      the_starfish_story_description_html: "<p>A man was walking along a deserted
        beach at sunset.<br /><br> As he walked he could see a young boy in the distance,
        as he drew nearer he noticed that the boy kept bending down, picking something
        up and throwing it into the water.<br /><br> Time and again he kept hurling
        things into the ocean.<br/><br> As the man approached even closer, he was
        able to see that the boy was picking up starfish that had been washed up on
        the beach and, one at a time he was throwing them back into the water.<br
        /><br> The man asked the boy what he was doing, the boy replied,&#8221; I
        am throwing these washed up starfish back into the ocean, or else they will
        die through lack of oxygen.<br /><br> &#8220;But&#8221;, said the man, &#8220;You
        can&#8217;t possibly save them all, there are thousands on this beach, and
        this must be happening on hundreds of beaches along the coast. You can&#8217;t
        possibly make a difference.&#8221;<br /><br> The boy smiled, bent down and
        picked up another starfish, and as he threw it back into the sea, he replied
        <strong>&#8220;Made a difference to that one&#8221;</strong></p>"

      what_is_stuttering: What is stuttering?
      what_is_stuttering_description_html: "<p><strong>Stuttering and Stammering </strong>are
        two different words that are used to describe the same condition. Generally
        speaking &#8216;stuttering&#8217; is used more commonly in North America,
        Australia, and the Middle East while in UK they tend to use the word &#8216;stammering&#8217;.</p>
        <p>We do not know <strong>what causes stuttering</strong>, but research shows
        that a combination of factors is involved. Stammering affects four times as
        many men as women. Statistics show us that approximately 5 million plus adults
        in the Arabic countries stutter, which is about 1% of the adult population.</p>
        <p>It is vital to recognise that everyone who stammers is different, and stammers
        differently. Everyone is an <strong>individual</strong> and any therapy or
        training must respect your individuality. Therefore, every person who stammers
        is potentially an expert on their own stammering. Recognising and always respecting
        these very important facts is the foundation to The Starfish Project and its
        success in helping people in their <strong>recovery from stuttering</strong>.</p>
        <p><b>Stuttering</b> &#8211; is generally characterized by repetitions (sounds,
        syllables, part-words, whole words, phrases), pauses, and prolongations that
        differ in number and severity from those of &#8216;normally fluent&#8217;
        individuals. Whilst other disorders are characterised by disfluent speech,
        the patterns of disfluency in these other disorders differ from that seen
        in developmental stuttering."
